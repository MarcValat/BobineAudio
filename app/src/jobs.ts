/** An engine job (analysis, export) as a promise: `onLog` gets its progress
 * messages, `onStart` its id as soon as it's known (to cancel it), and it
 * settles with its result, its error, or JobCancelled.
 *
 * Batch mode awaits one job after the other rather than firing them all at
 * once: each analysis already uses every core (see analysis_cache /
 * features.py), so several at a time would oversubscribe them instead of
 * finishing sooner. Renders are lighter, but kept sequential too, for the
 * same predictable one-at-a-time progress and to avoid writing several
 * large output files to disk at once. */
